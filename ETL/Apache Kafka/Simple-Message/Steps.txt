Download Kafka, by running the command below:

Step 1: wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/kafka/2.8.0/kafka_2.12-2.8.0.tgz
        Extract kafka from the zip file by running the command below.
        tar -xzf kafka_2.12-2.8.0.tgz

        This creates a new directory ‘kafka_2.12-2.8.0’ in the current directory.

Step 2: ZooKeeper is required for Kafka to work. Start the ZooKeeper server.

        cd kafka_2.12-2.8.0
        bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties

Step 3: Start a new terminal.
        Run the commands below. This will start the Kafka message broker service.

        cd kafka_2.12-2.8.0
        bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties

Step 4: Create a topic (Start a new terminal)
        Create a topic named "example1":

        cd kafka_2.12-2.8.0
        bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic test

        See list of topics using the following command:

        bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --zookeeper localhost:2181 test


Step 5: Run consumer and producer
        In separate command shells, run the following:

        python consumer.py
        This is a consumer of the messages sent through Kafka. Simple writing to CSV of the streams is implemented.

        Note: Press CTRL + C to send KeyboardInterrupt to exit the process. Alternatively, close the shell session.

        python producer.py
        Producer of messages. Key in any valid string to send. Type "quit" to exit.

        You should now see the shell running consumer.py displaying the messages from Kafka!

Step 6: Tear things down

        bin/kafka-server-stop.sh
        bin/zookeeper-server-stop.sh

        This would terminate both server processes.
